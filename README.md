I couldn't remember what this does, but apparently:

    /*
     * Uses a stochastic hillclimber to solve the problem of placing nodes inside
     * a shape such that the union of the neighborhoods of the nodes includes the
     * whole shape, minimized for the amount of nodes needed.
     */

In other words, if I want to cover an area with cell towers, then it
tells me where to put the cell towers so that I need the least amount of
cell towers (given the range of a cell tower and the shape of the area).
I doubt it works, but I'm throwing it up here anyway, to represent the fact
that I do actually know Java (though I don't prefer it).
